(optional),too many false alerts,False Alerts,,Accuracy,,false alerts,too many false alerts/no alerts,,inactive alert,missed events,number of false alerts,This system is worse than the previous 2 systems in the sense that it sends out more false alerts. More false alerts lead to both rounds having a loss rather than profit/bonus. Thus; once again this system needsto improve on its alert system and the truthfulness of the alerts.,immediately getting an alert of someone not being checked for a long time after just checking on residents,Quicker alerts and less false alerts! Some risks were not picked up by the system at all,the event should include the percentage of accuracy for each event,false alarm,,,,
